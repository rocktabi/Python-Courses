    "1. List : It stores the ordered sequence of objects : [1, 2, \"Somendra\", \"Solo\", 6, 7, 8]\n",
    "    Java Sytntax : int [] arr = new int[2]\n",
    "    1. Size is fixed.\n",
    "    2. It is only going to store integer type value but in python it is going to store any type of object.\n",

    "2. Dictionary : In dictinary we store the data in the form of key value pairs. It is something which stores mapping in it. In the below example delhi is mapped to india.  {\"key\" : \"value\"}.\n",
    "    example : {\n",
    "        \"India\" : \"Delhi\",\n",
    "        \"USA\" : \"Washington DC\"\n",

    "3. Tuples : It is similar to lists. It is immutable by immutable we understand that its value cannot be changed. It is fixed. \n",
    "    example : (1, 2, \"3\", \"SOmendra\") \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Sets : It is something which stores the unique elements in it and that is unordered. \n",
    "    example : {\"India\", \"USA\", \"Germany\"}\n"
